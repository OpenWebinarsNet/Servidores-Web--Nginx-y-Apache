Let's see how to use Nginx to host a PHP website and solve the problems:
* Nginx 403 forbidden
* PHP file downloaded instead of run

Nginx configuration file with PHP support:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_server_domain_or_IP;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.x-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
